### Environments

#### Building your Environment

When creating a digital project it is important to know what underlying softwares, platforms, libraries, code, etc. we are utilizing. By keeping track of these elements we can make sure that our future work and that of researchers that build upon our efforts can execute our codes.
But this can be a very time consuming task especially when it is not built in into the workflows that we already use on our day-to-day practices. For this very reason we utilize containers that exist to help you standardize and be able to distribute your environments.

But it is not enough to just utilize already tested environments or possibly package our own. We need to be able to also track our dependecies as they get __increasingly__ complicated as this next picture illustrates perfectly.
